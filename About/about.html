    <blockquote cite="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Child_Development_Services">
        <b>Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)</b> is a government program in India which provides nutritional meals,<mark style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(51, 102, 204);" >preschool</mark> education, <mark style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(51, 102, 204);"> primary healthcare</mark>, immunization, health check-up and referral services to children under 6 years of age and their mothers. The scheme was launched in 1975, discontinued in 1978 by the government of Morarji Desai, and then relaunched by the Tenth Five Year Plan.
           <br>
           <br>
        Tenth five-year plan also linked ICDS to <mark style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(51, 102, 204);" >Anganwadi</mark> centres established mainly in rural areas and staffed with frontline workers. In addition to improving <mark style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(51, 102, 204);" >child nutrition</mark>and immunization, the programme is also intended to combat <mark style="background-color:transparent; color:rgb(51, 102, 204);" >gender inequality</mark> by providing girls the same resources as boys.
